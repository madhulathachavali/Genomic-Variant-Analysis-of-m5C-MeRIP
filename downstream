1. Variant Annotation
Tool: ANNOVAR, VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)
Purpose: Annotate variants with functional information.
Output: Annotated VCF file with functional impact predictions.
2. Variant Filtering and Prioritization
Tool: bcftools, custom scripts
Purpose: Filter variants based on criteria such as quality, allele frequency, and predicted impact.
Output: Filtered list of high-confidence variants.
3. Functional Impact Prediction
Tool: SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion)
Purpose: Predict the potential impact of variants on protein function.
Output: List of variants with functional impact scores.
4. Pathway and Gene Set Analysis
Tool: GSEA, DAVID, Enrichr
Purpose: Identify enriched pathways and gene sets associated with the variants.
Output: List of significant pathways and gene sets.
5. Comparative Analysis
Tool: Public databases like TCGA, GTEx, 1000 Genomes Project
Purpose: Compare your variants with known variants in public datasets.
Output: Insights into the frequency and significance of your variants in different populations and contexts.
6. Literature Review and Database Search
Tool: PubMed, ClinVar, OMIM
Purpose: Search for existing literature and clinical significance of the identified variants.
Output: List of variants with known clinical or biological significance.
7. Visualization and Reporting
Tool: IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), R, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Purpose: Visualize the distribution and impact of variants.
Output: Figures and plots for publication or presentation.
Example Workflow
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline incorporating the above points:

# Step 1: Variant Annotation
# ANNOVAR example command
perl annotate_variation.pl -out results/annotated -build hg38 input.vcf humandb/

# Step 2: Variant Filtering and Prioritization
# Filter variants with bcftools
bcftools filter -i 'QUAL>20 && INFO/DP>10' results/annotated.vcf > results/filtered.vcf

# Step 3: Functional Impact Prediction
# Run CADD on filtered variants
cadd.sh -g GRCh38 -v results/filtered.vcf > results/cadd_output.tsv

# Step 4: Pathway and Gene Set Analysis
# Example GSEA analysis in R
Rscript -e "
library(clusterProfiler)
gene_list <- read.csv('results/gene_list.csv')
gsea_result <- gseGO(geneList = gene_list, OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, keyType = 'ENSEMBL', ont = 'BP')
write.csv(gsea_result, 'results/gsea_result.csv')
"

# Step 5: Comparative Analysis
# Use dbSNP or gnomAD for population frequency comparison (manual step)

# Step 6: Literature Review and Database Search
# Use PubMed for literature search (manual step)
# Use ClinVar and OMIM for clinical significance search (manual step)

# Step 7: Visualization and Reporting
# Python example for plotting variant impact
python3 -c "
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('results/cadd_output.tsv', sep='\t')
plt.hist(data['CADD_score'], bins=50)
plt.xlabel('CADD Score')
plt.ylabel('Number of Variants')
plt.title('Distribution of CADD Scores')
plt.savefig('results/cadd_score_distribution.png')
