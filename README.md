# Project Overview: Genomic Variant Analysis of m5C MeRIP Sequencing in PANC-1 Cells

This project focuses on the genomic variant analysis of m5C MeRIP sequencing data from PANC-1 cells treated with CAF-derived extracellular vesicles (Evs). The data, sourced from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession SRX24250599, was submitted by Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The workflow includes quality control, trimming, alignment to the GRCh38 reference genome, variant calling, and functional annotation to identify and interpret significant genomic variants.
